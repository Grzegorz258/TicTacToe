# TicTacToe

TicTacToe game is a first component of bigger application. I want to make one or two more minigames and merge them in one application.
This game is my first project in C# and XAML. I'm still learning so I think that it will be possible to improve this minigame in future.


How can you start my minigame?
You need to download my repository as a .zip file or clone it.
The easiest way is to go to the bin/Debug/ folder and run TicTacToe.exe. This way you don't need any software to run the game.
Another way is open TicTacToe.sln file but you need Visual Studio Community 2019(can also be Enterprise or Proffesional).
After opening the application, you can press CTRL+F5 (the default shortcut to run the program).
